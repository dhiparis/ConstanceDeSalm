# Management for the Twitter-Account of Constance de Salm #

Follow Constance de Salm on Twitter: https://twitter.com/constancesalm

This folder contains the project for the development of a Twitter-Bot for Constance de Salm. It will tweet randomly the 
first sentences of her letters always twice a day between 7 am and 9 pm... Therefore, we build flashcards using a svg 
sample-file. Based on this we generated all flashcards and exported them in png-format. The tweets are containing urls 
to a cloud which contains the generated files.
